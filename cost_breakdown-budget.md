# Overview of Cost Management and Billing Dashboards
## Azure
The Azure Cost Management + Billing was easy to access as the icon was already preset to the home page. After clicking the icon, I was led to the main overview page:

Navigating how to create a budget was relatively straightforward. I set my budget to $5.00 a month and was able to set an alert on when my budget reached 80%.

Once completed, I headed over to the cost analysis tab. A pop-up stated that the budget might take a couple of hours to reflect properly in the cost analysis. Currently, I do not have any data on the budget for my cost analysis. The current advisor recommendations were general since I had no specific budget data to reflect on.

## Google Cloud Platform
GCP's billing was also fairly straightforward to access.

There was already a widget to set a monthly budget and create an alert on the overview page.

Using the same budget as Azure, I set my monthly budget to $5.00. Once the budget was created, it brought me to a page where I could edit and set alerts.

Unlike Azure, GCP already provided prefilled thresholds for the percent of the budget I would like to receive an alert. 
I removed the last option of alerting me when the budget reached 150%, as that would mean I've overspent the budget, which I'd like to avoid. 
The alert thresholds were set to 50%, 90%, and 99%.

The cost breakdown is currently at $0.00 as there haven't been any changes made to the account.

Unlike Azure, there was no 'current advisor recommendations' tab. Instead, I had to return to the overview page and look under 'Billing Health Checks'. 


## Final Thoughts 
I found the billing management tabs in Azure and GCP to be quite easy to navigate and understand. The cost breakdown in GCP might be a bit more useful than Azure's, as it provides both a link to download a CSV file and a link to view detailed cost reports.
